* It’s **very important** to understand that in the Express Disc installation, the first available drive will be **completely erased** unless you change the default storage settings!

* Create a user and make it administrator (a root password is optional)

* The installation may be quick or take some time, depending on the speed of your hardware ![](static/images/tip.png)
* Towards the end, enter your Amahi install code for this system. You should obtain your install code from [Amahi Control Panel](https://www.amahi.org)

  <a href="static/images/amahi-7-express/07-install-code.png" class="fancybox centered"><img src="static/images/amahi-7-express/07-install-code-thumb.png" alt="Install Code" /></a>

* The networking settings you previously set for this system in the Amahi Control Panel should match what you have in your network, or the installation may not work in your network ![](static/images/tip.png)
* You will be asked to reboot. The Operating System will then boot from the hard drive, to a text console.
* Amahi will fully configure in the background and reboot by itself **one last time**. This time it will boot with the static IP address you set up in the Amahi control panel.

# 3. Initialize Amahi and start using it

* It is recommended for best operation that you turn off all other DHCP servers in your network. Then reboot all the systems in your network so that they get their network settings from your new Amahi server ![](static/images/tip.png)
* Open an Internet browser from a client machine and type `http://hda/` in the URL box
* This will bring you to an initialization web page for your system

* If `http://hda/` does not work , you could try the IP address of your system to get to the initialization page. This may be an indication the install did *not* go well, however. ![](static/images/tip.png)
* If you have networking trouble, make sure the settings in the control panel are what the network expects. Otherwise you can try the [Networking Troubleshooter](http://www.amahi.net).
* You will be asked to enter a username and password. Make sure you use the same capitalization here that you used for your username and password earlier

* Start setting up your users, your shares, install some apps and enjoy!!!
