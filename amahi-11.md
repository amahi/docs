title: Install Amahi 11
---

Welcome to to the **Amahi 11** release!

The best and recommended way to get Amahi 11 up and running is installing from scratch.

However, we also list some alternative options below.

# Installing from Scratch

Installing Amahi fresh is the recommended way to install. It requires the installation of Fedora 27 first. Then Amahi proper. After that is done, you should transition your network devices to using Amahi!

Only 64-bit systems are supported. We do not plan to support 32-bit systems in the future.

Follow the [directions to install Amahi 11](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_11_Install).

# Upgrading to Amahi 11

Upgrading from an existing 64-bit Amahi 10-running system is supported **to a limited extent**.

We have tested this installation path with a fair bit of success, with clean versions and fully-updated versions of Amahi 10. If your system is somewhat modified, it **may not upgrade well**. We cannot possibly support all system hardware/sw configurations.

We **strongly** recommend uninstalling all apps (or as many apps as possible) and reinstalling them after the upgrade.

Visit the [Amahi 10 to Amahi 11](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_11_Upgrade) install guide.

Upgrading from Amahi 8 is not supported, though it may work, if you try it via the OS. Upgrading from earlier releases is not supported. We recommend a fresh install.
